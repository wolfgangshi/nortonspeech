1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,500
First of all, let me say that I am delighted to be back home at Harvard.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,500
I'm also somewhat petrified at the grandeur of the poetic chair I am occupying;

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
a chair which has over the years grown into soemthing more like a throne,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,500
owing to the long list of eminent persons who have occupied it.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,500
It's a tough act to follow, but I am comforted by the sense of having come home again,

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,500
and happy to be realizing my old student fantacy of what it's like to be on the other side of the desk.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,500
Now that I AM on the side of the desk, all I seem to be able to think about is how it felt to be on THAT side,

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Felt good -- if you want to know the truth -- those thirty years ago.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
Maybe because I was very lucky in my masters:

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,500
Piston and Merit in Music; Patridge and Spenser in Literature;

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,500
Demoson and Hocking in Philosophy.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,500
But there was one master who bridge it all for me.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,500
Through whom the sense of beauty, analytic method, and historical perspective,

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,500
all came together in one luminous revelation.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
And I would like to dedicate this six lectures to his memory.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,500
He was professor David Prall of the philosophy department

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,500
-- a brilliant scholar and a deeply sensitive aesthitician.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,500
It was in this now disdained and rather unfashionable field of aesthetics,

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,500
that I learned from him not only a great deal about the philosophy of beauty,

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,500
but also the fact that David Prall was himself an instance of the beauty he loved,

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,500
in mind, heart and spirit.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,500
Those are terribly old-fastioned words in these days of behaviouristic of obsessiveness,

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,500
and I hope you will pardon such ancient words as mind, heart and spirit specially since I believe them as strongly now as I did then.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,500
Perhaps the principal thing I absorbed from professor Prall and from Harvard in general,

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,500
was the inter-disciplinary spirit, that the best way to know a thing is in a context of another discipline.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,500
So these lectures are given in that spirit of cross disciplines which is why

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,500
I'll be speaking of music along with quixotic forays into such fields as poetry,

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,500
linguistics, aesthetics and -- even heaven help us -- a bit elementary physics.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,500
The title of this lecture series is borrowed from Charlse Ives

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,500
who wrote that brief but remarkable piece of his called "The Unanswered Questions" way back in 1908.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,500
Ives had a highly metaphysical question in mind,

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,500
but I've always felt he was also asking another question, a highly a purely musical one:

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,500
whither music, as that question must have been asked by musical man entering the 20th century,

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,500
today with that century 65 years older, we are still asking it.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,500
Only it is not quite the same question as it was then, and so the purpose of these six lectures is not so much to answer the question as to understand it,

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,500
to redefine it, even to guess at the answer to whither music, we must first ask whence(?) music, what music, whose music.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,500
It will be pretentious to assume that by the end of the series we will answer the ultimate question,

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,500
but it's reasonable to assume that we'll be at a better position to make some educated guesses.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,500
Let me start with a particularly nostalgic and vivid recollection from my years with professor Prall.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,500
The time back in 1937, when I first heard a recording of Alvin Coplin's piano variations,

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,500
I fell in love with the music. It seemed so fiece and poetic, and utterly new.

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,500
This music opened up new worlds of musical possibilities to me,

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,500
and I wrote a raving report on it for my aesthetics course,

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,500
and Professor Prall became so interested in it that he decided he wanted to learn it himself.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,500
What a man, even bought me the sheet music!

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,500
So I learned it and taught it to him and he taught it back to me, and we analysed it together, and it became our song.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,500
This is now just a sentimental anecdote, because as we were analysing the Colplin variations I made a startling discovery,

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,500
that the first four notes of the piece,

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,500
which are the germ of the whole composition, are really these four notes,

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,500
with the fourth note at an octive higher.

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,500
And I suddenly perceived that the same four notes in another order

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,500
form the subject of Bach's C sharp minor fugue, from the well tempered clavier chord

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,500
And then I discovered that the same four notes transposed, with the first note repeated,

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,500
germinating the variations in Stravinsky's Octet.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,500
And the same four notes then popped up yet in another order and key as the initial motto of Ravel's Spanish Rhapsody.

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,500
And on top of all that I suddenly recalled some Hindu music I had heard -- I was a big oriental music buff at the time,

57
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,500
and there woo the same four notes again.

58
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,500
And at that moment, a notion was born in my brain

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,500
that there must be some deep primal reason why these discrete structures of the same four notes

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,500
should be at the very heart of such disparate musics as those of Bach, Colplin, Stravinsky, Ravel and the UdeShanka(?) dance company.

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,500
And all this, and more, I poured out to David Prall, and that was my first Norton lecture to an audience of one.

62
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,500
And from that time to this, the notion of a worldwide inborn musical grammar has haunted me.

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,500
But I will never have dreamed of basic lectures series on a notion so ill-defined and apparantly non-verifiable,

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,500
if it were not for the extraordinary materials that have appeared in recent years on the similar idea of a universal grammar underline human speech.

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,500
I've been profoundly impreesed and encouraged by the burgeoning of thought in this relatively new linguistic area;

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,500
an area that might be called Chomtskian.

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,500
By so name it I don't mean to restrict my observations to known Chomtsky's work alone.

68
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,500
It's a term of convenience, since he is the best known, most revolutionary and best publicised name in that area.

69
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Along his collegues and disciples, many of whom are now in radical disagreement with him,

70
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,500
he has produced a body of work that has re-invagorated linguistics to a point where it seems new light may be shed

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,500
on the nature and structural functions of that elusive thing called Mind.

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,500
In other words, by studying in depth why we talk the way we do, by abstracting the logic principles of language,

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,500
we maybe at a position to discover how we can communicate in a larger sense through music, through the arts in general,

74
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,500
and ultimately through all our societal behaviour.

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,500
We may even discover how we are mentally constituted because language is species-specific,

76
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,500
that is it's common to all of us who belong to the human species and only to us.

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,500
Of course tomorrow morning cheerful new facts about dolphins

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,500
or certain chimpanzee named Zira may throw a monkey wrench to the works,

79
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,500
but meanwhile this philosophical science called linguistics

80
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,500
seems to have become our newest key to self discovery; with each passing year seems to substanciate ever more convincingly

81
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,500
the hypothesis of the innate grammatical competence as Chomtsky calls it,

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,500
genetically endowed language faculty which is universal;

83
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,500
it's a human endowment; it proclaims the autonomy of the human spirit.

84
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,500
Well, so does music. But how do we investigate musical universality by so scientific a means as linguistic analogy?

85
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,500
Music is supposed to be a metaphorical phenomenon, some kind of mysterious symbolisation of our inner most affective existence.

86
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,500
It lends itself more easily to descriptions in purple prose than in equations.

87
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,500
And even so great a scientist as Einstein said that the most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious

88
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
-- of course he played the fiddle and he loved music.

89
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,500
But then why do some many of us constantly try to explain the beauty of music?

90
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,500
That's apparently depriving it of it's own mystery.

91
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,500
The fact is that music is not only a mysterious and metaphorical art, it is also in itself a science;

92
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,500
it's made of mathmatically measurable elements: frequencies, durations, decibels, intervals.

93
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:35,500
So any explication of music must combine mathematics with aesthetics just as linguistics combine mathematics with philosophy, or sociology, or whatever.

94
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,500
It is precisely for this inter-disciplinary reason that I'm so attracted by the new linguistics as a fresh approach to music,

95
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,500
(quite not)??? as the study of musical linguistics, just as there already exist as a psyco-linguistics, and a socio-linguistics.

96
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:06,500
Alright, let's try it. Luckily the study of linguistics is a three fold science and so provides us with three handy categories in which these lectures can be conceived.

97
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,500
One phonology, two syntax, and three semantics.

98
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,500
Phonology, syntax, semantics, these are three departments of linguistics and they point the way for our musical investigations as well.

99
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:33,500
In this first lecture, we will oriented phonologically, examining both language and music from a most fundamental point of view that of sound itself;

100
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,500
the stuff of which verbal and musical utterences are made.

101
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,500
And that should give us a solid base to build on, so that in our next session we can plunge into syntax,

102
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,500
the actual structures that arise from that phonologic stuff.

103
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,500
From then on, the remaining four lectures will confront the challenges of semantics, that is meaning, both musical and extra-musical meaning.

104
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,500
Semantics can be seen as the natural result of adding phonology and syntax together: sound plus structure.

105
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,500
And the resultant semantic enquiry will bring us around back to Ives unanswered question whither music in our time.

106
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,500
And now you can see why I became so excited when I began reading the new linguistics,

107
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:36,500
which postulated the notion of innate linguistic competence, because suddenly my old under-graduated notion of a universal muscial grammar was re-animated.

108
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,500
It lay dormant for years, paralysed, I suppose, by that deadly cliche: Music is the universal language of mankind.

109
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,500
After a thousand repetitions of that one, usually with the connotation support your local symphony orchestra,

110
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,500
the well-meant phase becomes not only a cliche, but a misleading one.

111
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,500
How many of you can listen to forty minutes of a Hindu Raga with intelligent comprehension,

112
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,500
to say nothing of merely saying awake.

113
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,500
And how about certain kinds of avant-garde music: not so universal, are they?

114
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,500
Well, thought I so much for the universal language of mankind.

115
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,500
But then when I began reading the new lingustics, I thought here is a fresh way to pursue my intuitive idea,

116
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,500
which had grown still and deteriorated into a platitude.

117
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,500
In other words, by building analogies between muscial and linguistc procedures,

118
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,500
couldn't that cliche of that universal language be debunked? Or confirmed? Or at least clarified?

119
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,500
OK, let's clarify. Universality is a big word and a dangerous one.

120
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,500
At the same time that it implies likeness as it also implies diversity.

121
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Remember Montaigne's remark that "the most universal quality of man is his diversity".

122
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,500
This paradox lies at the very heart of linguistics study

123
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,500
because at the same time that a linguist is investigating any one particular language or even a family of languages,

124
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,500
trying to formulate a descriptive grammar,

125
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,500
is also searching for the underlying similarities among different languages or families of languages.

126
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
At least the new linguists are.

127
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,500
They construct these descriptive grammars by analysing the mental processes of human speech,

128
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,500
that's deriving sets of rules that hopefully apply to all human languages,

128
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,500
in fact to all possible human languages, both known and unknown.

129
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,500
Now that's a tall order, but a magnificent goal requiring an inspiring guess of the great scientific leap of the mind.

130
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:06,500
And if that goal can be attained and the universality principle proved, it can turn out to be a timely and welcome affirmation of human brotherhood.

131
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,500
But how do linguists go about such a task? Well, one way is by seeking out what they call substantive universals.

132
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,500
For example, in the realm of phonology, which is our main concern in this lecture,

133
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,500
linguists propose a substantive universal which says the following: all languages share certain phonemes in common,

134
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,500
that is minimal speech units that arise natually from the physiological structure of our mouths, throats and noses.

135
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,500
Since we all share those features we share likewise the sound "A" for instance,

136
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,500
a sound produced by simply opening the mouth and vocolising it -- "A".

137
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,500
Every normal human being can do this in any language, there is simply no exception,

138
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,500
even though the vowel may vary according to the shape of the oral cavity, or according to one's social background,

139
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,500
producing such variance as "cla:ss" and "class" and "claess".

140
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,500
But they are all versions of the same phoneme "A", and so must be considered universal.

141
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,500
Now that's a substantive universal voile.

142
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:29,500
Other linguists, of course I'm skipping enormous numbers of other substantive universals and distinctive features, I don't want to burden you with all that,

143
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,500
but other, certain other linguists go about seeking universals in different ways, such as etymologists,

144
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,500
who point out that the interesting thing about the Spainsh word "allad", to speak, and the Portuguese equivalent "fallad", to speak,

145
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:57,500
is not that they seem to be totally different words, but that they are the same word deriving from the same Latin root "fabolale",

146
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,500
but with phonetic deviations.

147
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,500
Let's not go into why they are deviated, though it's a facinating subject. Let's agree only about the common origin.

148
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,500
There's the key, common origin.

149
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,500
Because one continues in this way, working backwards through history in search of even ealier common origins,

150
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,500
one arrives at startling points of universality, only such investigation has to stop short as soon as written languages run out.

151
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,500
Because obviously the ultimate evidence of universality in speech is to be sought in the oldest languages of Man,

152
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,500
pre-historical languages which preceded, so to speak, the Tower of Babel moment in human evolution.

153
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,500
But such ancient languages simply don't exist.

154
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,500
They were spoken millions of years ago, long before written languages be developed, which was only thousands of years ago.

155
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,500
And so being stuck with out-written evidence, historical linguists are forced into speculation.

156
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:11,500
Ideally, what they are seeking is a parent language, one universal tongue that may have been common to all of early mankind.

157
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,500
And that's the tallest order of all, because it means wandering in the mists of pre-history.

158
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,500
One tangible accomplishment at least has been to find a name for this field of enquiry,

159
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,500
and that name is "monogenesis", denoting the theory of all languages bringing from a single source.

160
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,500
A fine word, monogenesis, and a thilling idea.

161
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,500
It thrills me anyway to the point where I stayed up all of one night, making monogenetic speculations of my own.

162
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,500
I tried to imagine myself a hominid, and tried to feel what a very very ancient ancestor of mine

163
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,500
might have felt and might have been impelled to express verbally.

164
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,500
I scribbled pages full of basic mono-syllables which felt somehow right, which seem to belong together,

165
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,500
and which delighted me with their curious logic. I began by imagining myself a homonid infant,

166
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,500
just lying there contentedly trying out my new-found voice. Um...

167
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,500
Then I got hungary, Um..! Calling my mother's attentions to my hunger. And as I opened my mouth to receive the nipple,

168
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,500
Um..Ah! Know I've invented my primal word -- Ma, mother.

170
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,500
This is got to be one of the first proto words ever uttered by Man.

171
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,500
Still to this day, most languages have a word for mother that employs that root -- "Ma", or some phonetic variant for it.

172
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:01,500
All the Romance languages... so on the Germanic.... Slavic... Hebrew ... Navajo, even Navajo, even Swahili

173
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,500
and Japanese and Chinese, they call her Mama.

Well, that was a small triumph. And then I began expanding.

What about "Ma" plus "L"? Say, "mal". Well, now there's a proto syllable for you.

My first association, of course, was with all the familiar words connoting badness: "malo", "male", "molve".

All Latin derived languages, of course; then I thought, in the Slavic family of languages, that syllable connotes smallness:

"malle", "malo", "malinky" and so on.

Sudden hypothesis: could there just possibly be a monogenetic connection way back then between the concepts of badness and smallness.

Why not? Remember we are being harmonids now and it's perfectly conceivable that what small must be automatically bad.

To be small is to be weak, to be only human, as against the powerful gods; as against the huge magical earth and sky.

Hence weaknesses undesirable, hence bad. It's bad to have small harvest, small images, small stature, small dinner, "malo".

Then I thought, if that's true, then big must equal good; there must be a corresponding kinship between bigness and goodness.

So when I went searching through all the dictionaries I can find, what do you think? I found it.

Most familiar root denoting bigness is "er" -- the growling of the big tiger, produce all the big words: grandy, grandir, grace, grow and even including () in Dutch

where g is soften to the gutteral ().

And all these are in Latin and Germanic, but again look at the Slavic, where again the "g" is gutteralised to "h"

And behold the glorious word (), which means so inevitably and comfortingly good.

And () is brave and big brave good and God.

Somehow it all adds up. Way back before and behind and beyond all these comparatively recent languages,

there must lurk, I fondly hoped, one universal pararnt tongue, which contains the great simultaneous equation:

big equals good and small equals bad. Triumph!

By why am I burdening your with my private game playing? This less than scientific speculation, it's hardly what a liguist will call authentic.

I cannot say strongly enough that I claim the right to be wrong. It's every teacher's academic right, and I stand ready to take the risk involved,

just as any theorist or scientist does.

So my monogenetic speculation interests me and I hope you because of what it suggests about music.

The origins of music and the very nature of musical materials, the notes themselves.

Let's make a simple analogy and return for a second to being that harmonid infant who invent that proto word - "ma"

And we quickly learn to associate that morpheme with our supplier of milk, right?

So we call her when we need her -- "ma".

Now on a pure phonological level, that begins at sound, begins with an attack, an ictus.

"ma" and ends in a descending glide.

"ma" that's the way we speak, ictus plus glide.

Of course the glide may also be upward if the intention is interogative -- "ma".

Now let's feel a tremendous intensification of our need, of our hunger, of our patience,

so we intensify the ictus by prolonging it -- "ma--"

And lo and behold we are singing; music is born; the syllable has become a note.

"ma--" just eliminate the glide; or to use our technical jargon of our time: the morpheme is re-written as a pitch event.

And what a event that must have been way back then.

What we seem to be getting to is a hypothesis that will confirm another famous cliche, namely music is hightened speech.

After all what causes such a hightening? Intensified emotions, hunger, impatience.

Certainly the deepest universals we all share -- emotions, affects.

We all have the same capacity for passion, fear, anticipation, aggression.

We all display the same physiological manifestations of affect:

our eyebrows go up with anticipation; our hearts pound with passion; and fear affects us universally with gooseflesh.
