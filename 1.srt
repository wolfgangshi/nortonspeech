1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,500
First of all, let me say that I am delighted to be back home at Harvard.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,500
I'm also somewhat petrified at the grandeur of the poetic chair I am occupying;

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,500
a chair which has over the years grown into soemthing more like a throne,

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,500
owing to the long list of eminent persons who have occupied it.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,500
It's a tough act to follow, but I am comforted by the sense of having come home again,

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,500
and happy to be realizing my old student fantacy of what it's like to be on the other side of the desk.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,500
Now that I AM on the side of the desk, all I seem to be able to think about is how it felt to be on THAT side,

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Felt good -- if you want to know the truth -- those thirty years ago.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
Maybe because I was very lucky in my masters:

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,500
Piston and Merit in Music; Patridge and Spenser in Literature;

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,500
Demoson and Hocking in Philosophy.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,500
But there was one master who bridge it all for me.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,500
Through whom the sense of beauty, analytic method, and historical perspective,

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,500
all came together in one luminous revelation.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
And I would like to dedicate this six lectures to his memory.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,500
He was professor David Prall of the philosophy department

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,500
-- a brilliant scholar and a deeply sensitive aesthitician.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,500
It was in this now disdained and rather unfashionable field of aesthetics,

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,500
that I learned from him not only a great deal about the philosophy of beauty,

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,500
but also the fact that David Prall was himself an instance of the beauty he loved,

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,500
in mind, heart and spirit.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,500
Those are terribly old-fastioned words in these days of behaviouristic of obsessiveness,

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,500
and I hope you will pardon such ancient words as mind, heart and spirit specially since I believe them as strongly now as I did then.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,500
Perhaps the principle thing I absorbed from professor Prall and from Harvard in general,

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,500
was the inter-disciplinary spirit, that the best way to know a thing is in a context of another discipline.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,500
So these lectures are given in that spirit of cross disciplines which is why

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,500
I'll be speaking of music along with quixotic forays into such fields as poetry,

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,500
linguistics, aesthetics and -- even heaven help us -- a bit elementary physics.

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,500
The title of this lecture series is borrowed from Charlse Ives

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,500
who wrote that brief but remarkable piece of his called "The Unanswered Questions" way back in 1908.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,500
Ives had a highly metaphysical question in mind,

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,500
but I've always felt he was also asking another question, a highly a purely musical one:

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,500
whither music, as that question must have been asked by musical man entering the 20th century,

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,500
today with that century 65 years older, we are still asking it.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,500
Only it is not quite the same question as it was then, and so the purpose of these six lectures is not so much to answer the question as to understand it,

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,500
to redefine it, even to guess at the answer to whither music, we must first ask whence music, what music, whose music.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,500
It will be pretentious to assume that by the end of the series we will answer the ultimate question,

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,500
but it's reasonable to assume that we'll be at a better position to make some educated guesses.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,500
Let me start with a particularly nostalgic and vivid recollection from my years with professor Prall.

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,500
The time back in 1937, when I first heard a recording of Aaron Copland's piano variations,

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,500
I fell in love with the music. It seemed so fiece and poetic, and utterly new.

42
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,500
This music opened up new worlds of musical possibilities to me,

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,500
and I wrote a raving report on it for my aesthetics course,

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,500
and Professor Prall became so interested in it that he decided he wanted to learn it himself.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,500
What a man, even bought me the sheet music!

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,500
So I learned it and taught it to him and he taught it back to me, and we analysed it together, and it became our song.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,500
This is now just a sentimental anecdote, because as we were analysing the Copland variations I made a startling discovery,

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,500
that the first four notes of the piece,

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,500
which are the germ of the whole composition, are really these four notes,

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,500
with the fourth note at an octive higher.

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,500
And I suddenly perceived that the same four notes in another order

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,500
form the subject of Bach's C sharp minor fugue, from the well tempered clavier chord

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,500
And then I discovered that the same four notes transposed, with the first note repeated,

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,500
germinating the variations in Stravinsky's Octet.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,500
And the same four notes then popped up yet in another order and key as the initial motto of Ravel's Spanish Rhapsody.

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,500
And on top of all that I suddenly recalled some Hindu music I had heard -- I was a big oriental music buff at the time,

57
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,500
and there woo the same four notes again.

58
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,500
And at that moment, a notion was born in my brain

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,500
that there must be some deep primal reason why these discrete structures of the same four notes

60
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,500
should be at the very heart of such disparate musics as those of Bach, Copland, Stravinsky, Ravel and the UdeShanka(?) dance company.

61
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,500
And all this, and more, I poured out to David Prall, and that was my first Norton lecture to an audience of one.

62
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,500
And from that time to this, the notion of a worldwide inborn musical grammar has haunted me.

63
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,500
But I will never have dreamed of basic lectures series on a notion so ill-defined and apparantly non-verifiable,

64
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,500
if it were not for the extraordinary materials that have appeared in recent years on the similar idea of a universal grammar underline human speech.

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,500
I've been profoundly impreesed and encouraged by the burgeoning of thought in this relatively new linguistic area;

66
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,500
an area that might be called Chomtskian.

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,500
By so name it I don't mean to restrict my observations to known Chomtsky's work alone.

68
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,500
It's a term of convenience, since he is the best known, most revolutionary and best publicised name in that area.

69
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Along his collegues and disciples, many of whom are now in radical disagreement with him,

70
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,500
he has produced a body of work that has re-invagorated linguistics to a point where it seems new light may be shed

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,500
on the nature and structural functions of that elusive thing called Mind.

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,500
In other words, by studying in depth why we talk the way we do, by abstracting the logic principles of language,

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,500
we maybe at a position to discover how we can communicate in a larger sense through music, through the arts in general,

74
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,500
and ultimately through all our societal behaviour.

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,500
We may even discover how we are mentally constituted because language is species-specific,

76
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,500
that is it's common to all of us who belong to the human species and only to us.

77
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,500
Of course tomorrow morning cheerful new facts about dolphins

78
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,500
or certain chimpanzee named Zira may throw a monkey wrench to the works,

79
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,500
but meanwhile this philosophical science called linguistics

80
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,500
seems to have become our newest key to self discovery; with each passing year seems to substanciate ever more convincingly

81
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,500
the hypothesis of the innate grammatical competence as Chomtsky calls it,

82
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,500
genetically endowed language faculty which is universal;

83
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,500
it's a human endowment; it proclaims the autonomy of the human spirit.

84
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,500
Well, so does music. But how do we investigate musical universality by so scientific a means as linguistic analogy?

85
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,500
Music is supposed to be a metaphorical phenomenon, some kind of mysterious symbolisation of our inner most affective existence.

86
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,500
It lends itself more easily to descriptions in purple prose than in equations.

87
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,500
And even so great a scientist as Einstein said that the most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious

88
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
-- of course he played the fiddle and he loved music.

89
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,500
But then why do some many of us constantly try to explain the beauty of music?

90
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,500
That's apparently depriving it of it's own mystery.

91
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,500
The fact is that music is not only a mysterious and metaphorical art, it is also in itself a science;

92
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,500
it's made of mathmatically measurable elements: frequencies, durations, decibels, intervals.

93
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:35,500
So any explication of music must combine mathematics with aesthetics just as linguistics combine mathematics with philosophy, or sociology, or whatever.

94
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,500
It is precisely for this inter-disciplinary reason that I'm so attracted by the new linguistics as a fresh approach to music,

95
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Why not the study of musical linguistics, just as there already exist a psyco-linguistics, and a socio-linguistics?

96
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:06,500
Alright, let's try it. Luckily the study of linguistics is a three fold science and so provides us with three handy categories in which these lectures can be conceived.

97
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,500
One phonology, two syntax, and three semantics.

98
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,500
Phonology, syntax, semantics, these are three departments of linguistics and they point the way for our musical investigations as well.

99
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:33,500
In this first lecture, we will oriented phonologically, examining both language and music from a most fundamental point of view that of sound itself;

100
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,500
the stuff of which verbal and musical utterences are made.

101
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And that should give us a solid base to build on, so that in our next session we can plunge into syntax,

102
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,500
the actual structures that arise from that phonologic stuff.

103
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,500
From then on, the remaining four lectures will confront the challenges of semantics, that is meaning, both musical and extra-musical meaning.

104
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,500
Semantics can be seen as the natural result of adding phonology and syntax together: sound plus structure.

105
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,500
And the resultant semantic enquiry will inevitably bring us around back to Ives unanswered question whither music in our time.

106
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,500
And now you can see why I became so excited when I began reading the new linguistics,

107
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:36,500
which postulated the notion of innate linguistic competence, because suddenly my old under-graduated notion of a universal muscial grammar was re-animated.

108
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,500
It lay dormant for years, paralysed, I suppose, by that deadly cliche: Music is the universal language of mankind.

109
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,500
After a thousand repetitions of that one, usually with the connotation support your local symphony orchestra,

110
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,500
the well-meant phase becomes not only a cliche, but a misleading one.

111
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,500
How many of you can listen to forty minutes of a Hindu Raga with intelligent comprehension,

112
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,500
to say nothing of merely saying awake.

113
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,500
And how about certain kinds of avant-garde music: not so universal, are they?

114
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,500
Well, thought I so much for the universal language of mankind.

115
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,500
But then when I began reading the new lingustics, I thought here is a fresh way to pursue my intuitive idea,

116
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,500
which had grown still and deteriorated into a platitude.

117
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,500
In other words, by building analogies between muscial and linguistc procedures,

118
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,500
couldn't that cliche of that universal language be debunked? Or confirmed? Or at least clarified?

119
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,500
OK, let's clarify. Universality is a big word and a dangerous one.

120
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,500
At the same time that it implies likeness as it also implies diversity.

121
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Remember Montaigne's remark that "the most universal quality of man is his diversity".

122
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,500
This paradox lies at the very heart of linguistics study

123
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,500
because at the same time that a linguist is investigating any one particular language or even a family of languages,

124
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,500
trying to formulate a descriptive grammar,

125
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,500
is also searching for the underlying similarities among different languages or families of languages.

126
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
At least the new linguists are.

127
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,500
They construct these descriptive grammars by analysing the mental processes of human speech,

128
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,500
that's deriving sets of rules that hopefully apply to all human languages,

128
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,500
in fact to all possible human languages, both known and unknown.

129
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:55,500
Now that's a tall order, but a magnificent goal requiring an inspiring guess of the great scientific leap of the mind.

130
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:06,500
And if that goal can be attained and the universality principle proved, it can turn out to be a timely and welcome affirmation of human brotherhood.

131
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,500
But how do linguists go about such a task? Well, one way is by seeking out what they call substantive universals.

132
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,500
For example, in the realm of phonology, which is our main concern in this lecture,

133
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,500
linguists propose a substantive universal which says the following: all languages share certain phonemes in common,

134
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,500
that is minimal speech units that arise natually from the physiological structure of our mouths, throats and noses.

135
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,500
Since we all share those features we share likewise the sound "A" for instance,

136
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,500
a sound produced by simply opening the mouth and vocolising it -- "A".

137
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,500
Every normal human being can do this in any language, there is simply no exception,

138
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,500
even though the vowel may vary according to the shape of the oral cavity, or according to one's social background,

139
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,500
producing such variance as "cla:ss" and "class" and "claess".

140
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,500
But they are all versions of the same phoneme "A", and so must be considered universal.

141
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,500
Now that's a substantive universal voile.

142
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:29,500
Other linguists, of course I'm skipping enormous numbers of other substantive universals and distinctive features, I don't want to burden you with all that,

143
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,500
but other, certain other linguists go about seeking universals in different ways, such as etymologists,

144
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,500
who point out that the interesting thing about the Spainsh word "allad", to speak, and the Portuguese equivalent "fallad", to speak,

145
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:57,500
is not that they seem to be totally different words, but that they are the same word deriving from the same Latin root "fabolale",

146
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,500
but with phonetic deviations.

147
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:07,500
Let's not go into why they are deviated, though it's a facinating subject. Let's agree only about the common origin.

148
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,500
There's the key, common origin.

149
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,500
Because one continues in this way, working backwards through history in search of even ealier common origins,

150
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,500
one arrives at startling points of universality, only such investigation has to stop short as soon as written languages run out.

151
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,500
Because obviously the ultimate evidence of universality in speech is to be sought in the oldest languages of Man,

152
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,500
pre-historical languages which preceded, so to speak, the Tower of Babel moment in human evolution.

153
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,500
But such ancient languages simply don't exist.

154
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,500
They were spoken millions of years ago, long before written languages be developed, which was only thousands of years ago.

155
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,500
And so being stuck with out-written evidence, historical linguists are forced into speculation.

156
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:11,500
Ideally, what they are seeking is a parent language, one universal tongue that may have been common to all of early mankind.

157
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,500
And that's the tallest order of all, because it means wandering in the mists of pre-history.

158
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,500
One tangible accomplishment at least has been to find a name for this field of enquiry,

159
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,500
and that name is "monogenesis", denoting the theory of all languages bringing from a single source.

160
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,500
A fine word, monogenesis, and a thilling idea.

161
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,500
It thrills me anyway to the point where I stayed up all of one night, making monogenetic speculations of my own.

162
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,500
I tried to imagine myself a hominid, and tried to feel what a very very ancient ancestor of mine

163
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,500
might have felt and might have been impelled to express verbally.

164
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,500
I scribbled pages full of basic mono-syllables which felt somehow right, which seem to belong together,

165
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,500
and which delighted me with their curious logic. I began by imagining myself a homonid infant,

166
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,500
just lying there contentedly trying out my new-found voice. Um...

167
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,500
Then I got hungary, Um..! Calling my mother's attentions to my hunger. And as I opened my mouth to receive the nipple,

168
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,500
Um..Ah! Know I've invented my primal word -- Ma, mother.

170
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,500
This is got to be one of the first proto words ever uttered by Man.

171
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,500
Still to this day, most languages have a word for mother that employs that root -- "Ma", or some phonetic variant for it.

172
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:01,500
All the Romance languages... so on the Germanic.... Slavic... Hebrew ... Navajo, even Navajo, even Swahili

173
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,500
and Japanese and Chinese, they call her Mama.

174
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,500
Well, that was a small triumph. And then I began expanding.

175
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,500
What about "Ma" plus "L"? Say, "mal". Well, now there's a proto syllable for you.

176
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,500
My first association, of course, was with all the familiar words connoting badness: "malo", "male", "molve".

00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,500
All Latin derived languages, of course; then I thought, in the Slavic family of languages, that syllable connotes smallness:

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,500
"malle", "malinky" and so on.

00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,500
Sudden hypothesis: could there just possibly be a monogenetic connection

00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,500
way back then between the concepts of badness and smallness.

00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,500
Why not? Remember we are being harmonids now and it's perfectly conceivable that what small must be automatically bad.

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,500
To be small is to be weak, to be only human, as against the powerful gods; as against the huge magical earth and sky.

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,500
Hence weaknesses is undesirable, hence bad.

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,500
It's bad to have small harvest, small energy, small stature, small dinner, "malo".

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,500
Then I thought, if that's true, then big must equal good;

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,500
there must be a corresponding kinship between bigness and goodness.

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,500
So all I went searching through all the dictionaries I can find, and what do you think? I found it.

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,500
The most familiar root denoting bigness is "gr" --

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,500
the growling of the big tiger, producing all the big words: grandy,

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,500
grandir, gross, grace, grow and even including grandy in Dutch

00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,500
where g is soften to the gutteral "h".

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,500
And all these are in Latin and Germanic, but again look at the Slavic,

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,500
where again the "g" is gutteralised to "h"

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,500
And behold the glorious word ..., which means so inevitably and comfortingly good.

00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,500
And ... is brave and big brave good and God.

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,500
Somehow it all adds up. Way back before and behind and beyond all these comparatively recent languages,

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,500
there must lurk, I fondly hoped, one universal pararnt tongue,

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,500
which contains the great simultaneous equation:

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,500
big equals good and small equals bad. Triumph!

00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,500
By why am I burdening your with my private game playing?

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,500
This less than scientific speculation, it's hardly what a liguist will call authentic.

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:06,500
I cannot say strongly enough that I claim the right to be wrong. It's every teacher's academic right, and I stand ready to take the risk involved,

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,500
just as any theorist or scientist does.

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,500
So my monogenetic speculation interests me and I hope you because of what it suggests about music.

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,500
The origins of music and the very nature of musical material, the notes themselves.

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:33,500
Let's make a simple analogy and return for a second to being that harmonid infant who invent that proto word - "ma"

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,500
And we quickly learn to associate that morpheme with our supplier of milk, right?

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,500
And so we call her when we need her -- "ma".

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,500
Now on a purely phonological level, that begins at sound, begins with an attack, an ictus.

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,500
"ma" and ends in a descending glide.

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,500
"ma" that's the way we speak, ictus plus glide.

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,500
Of course the glide may also be upward if the intention is interogative -- "ma".

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,500
And now let's feel a tremendous intensification of our need, of our hunger, of our impatience,

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,500
and so we intensify the ictus by prolonging it -- "ma--"

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,500
And lo and behold we are singing; music is born; the syllable has become a note.

00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,500
"ma--" just eliminating the glide;

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,500
or to use the technical jargon of our time: the morpheme is re-written as a pitch event.

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,500
And what an event that must have been way back then.

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:47,500
What we seem to be getting to is a hypothesis that will confirm another famous cliche, namely music is hightened speech.

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,500
After all what causes such a hightening? Intensified emotions, hunger, impatience.

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,500
Certainly the deepest universals we all share are emotions, affects.

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,500
We all have the same capacity for passion, fear, anticipation, aggression.

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,500
We all display the same physiological manifestations of affect:

00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,500
our eyebrows go up with anticipation; our hearts pound with passion; and fear affects us universally with gooseflesh.

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,500
And in the sense that music may express those affects it is going on,

00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,500
then it must indeed be a universal language.

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,500
Maybe even a divine one to invoke yet another cliche.

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,500
I have often thought that if it's literally true that in the beginning was the word,

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,500
then it must have been a song word.

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,500
The Bible tells us the whole creation story not only verbally, but in terms of verbal creation:

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,500
God said let there be light. God said let there be a firmament. He created verbally.

00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,500
Can you imagine God saying just like that? "Let there be light." as if ordering lunch;

00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:12,500
or even in the original language .... I've always had a private fantacy of God singing those two blazing words.

00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,500
Now that could really have done it; music could have caused light to break forth.

00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,500
But all I have just done is to prolong the ictus again.

00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,500
What I have created is simply hightened speech, which was seemed to corroborate yet another cliche

00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,500
about music begining where language leaves off, I think Schopenhauer, that one.

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,500
In other words, if the theory of monogenesis is valid, and speech indeed has common origins;

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,500
and if the hightening of that speech produces music,

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,500
then music may also be said to have common origins; and is therefore universal

00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,500
whether the note issue from the Mouth of God or from that hungry infant.

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,500
But where do these notes come from? Why do I ears select certain notes and not others.

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,500
For example, why do children tease one other in a specific sing-song way.

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,500
Two very special notes, which children also use to call one another.

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,500
Jerry, Doris, whatever!

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,500
And which are often used by them in their singing games. Little Sally Water.

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,500
That's the same two notes, only now expanded to three notes.

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,500
Little Sally Water.

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,500
Or perhaps you once yells: Ali Ali Anfery. Does that sound familiar?

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,500
Well, again we must ask why just those notes in that particular order.

00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:01,500
Research seems to indicate that this exact constellation of two notes and its three note variant

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,500
is the same all over the world wherever children tease each other, on every continent and in every culture.

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,500
In short, we may have heard a clear case of a musical linguistic universal,

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,500
and one which can be identified and explained in a none-vacuous way.

00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,500
I want to take a little time to do this carefully because in the explanation lies the key to musical universality in general.

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,500
The answer to the question why just those notes,

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:40,500
and eventually to the question why those notes in Mozart,
and why those notes in Copland, or in Schönberg, or whoever.

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:47,500
And in having an answer, we musicians have a singular advantage over the linguists who ask their question:

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,500
why just those sounds in human speech?

00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,500
And they seek the answers by constructing a very complex hypothesis,

00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,500
which is still very much in the working stage,

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,500
subject to proof or disproof, amplification or derision.

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,500
But we musicians are luckier; we have the built-in, pre-ordained, universal, known as the harmonic series.

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,500
To those of you who know all about the harmonic series, I beg your indulgence for a few minutes,

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,500
so that I can sketch it out for those who don't.

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,500
This accoutic phenomenon, called the harmonic series or overtone series,

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,500
is not hard to understand, if you remember the basic high school fact:

00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,500
that all sounds are produced by vibrating bodies, which send out waves.

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:47,500
If such a vibrating body is irregularly constituted like this floor, or this piano,

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,500
it will emit waves which are irregular, and our ears will perceive them as noise
(Ou..)

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,500
But if the source of vibration is of a consistent structure, like anyone of the strings in this piano,

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,500
it will emit regular waves and we hear them as a musical tone.

00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,500
Of course the source does not have to be a string, it can be a column of air as in a clarinet,

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,500
or a column of steel as in a tubular bell, or a stretched animal hide as in a kettle drum.

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,500
But whatever it is it produces what's called energy in vibratory motion, that is the official language,

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,500
by being beaten, blown, plucked, struck or frictionised with a bow.

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,500
Let's settle for a piano string, let's say this one,

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,500
which is of a particular length, tension, thickness and density.

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,500
and when struck by its hammer produces sound waves of a frequency of 132 vibrations per second,

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,500
and is known to the world as the note C.

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,500
Now comes the interesting part, if I sit at the piano and play that low C,

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,500
you may think you are hearing only that one tone: a dark, rich, base note.

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,500
But you are not, you are simultaneously hearing a whole series of higher tones

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,500
that are sounding at the same time.

00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,500
These are arranged in an order preordained by nature and ruled by universal physical laws.

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,500
If this is news to you, I hope it's good news.

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,500
Because all these upper notes of which you may be unaware,

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:41,500
result from a phenomenon of nature, whereby any sound producing source,

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,500
or shall I say pitch producing source such as this piano string,

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,500
vibrates not only as the whole string in all its whatever inch glory sounding that low C;

00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,500
but also in fractional segments of that string, each vibrating separately.

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,500
It's as though the string were infinitely divisable into two halves,

00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,500
and into three thirds and four quarters and so on.

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,500
And the smaller those segments are, the faster they vibrate,

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,500
producing higher and higher frequencies, and therefore higher and higher tones,

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,500
overtones; or harmonics, says they are sometimes called.

00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,500
And these overtones or harmonics are all sounding together

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,500
with the fundamental sound of the full string;

00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,500
this is a basic principle by which the entire harmonic theory is generated.

00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,500
starting on any fundamental tone.

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,500
Now if you already knew all that from high school physics,

00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:49,000
you'll also know that these overtones are naturally less apparent to the ear than the fundamental,

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,500
which is in this case low C.

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,500
And in fact they sound more and more faintly as they go higher.

00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:02,500
Any note I strike will contain its own series of overtones.

00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:08,500
But the lower the note I strike, the more abundantly audible will be its homarnic series,

00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,500
which accouts in part for the comparative richness of this low C.

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,500
Now remember I spoke of the preordained order in which the overtones appear.

00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,500
Let's see if I can make you actually hear those overtones in that order.

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,500
The first overtone of the series according to the laws of physics

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,500
has to be exatly an octive higher than the fundamental C we've been hearing.

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,500
In other words, this got to be this C, an octive higher.

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,500
Now if I silently press down the key of this higher C,

00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,500
and hold it so that the string is free to vibrate. And then abruptly strike the fundamental C, an octive lower,

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,500
what do you hear?

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,500
You are clearly hearing the firat overtone vibrating sympathetically an octive above its fundamental.

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,500
I hope you heard it, did you? Listen again.

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,500
Clear as a bell. So obviously this upper C is an integral part of the C an octive below.

00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,500
It's a built-in harmonic sounded by the two halves of that lower string vibrating independently.

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,500
Of the next overtone of this preordained order, results from that same fundamental string

00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,500
vibrating in three parts;

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,500
and this one will be the first different overtone, that is the first one you will hear other than a C.

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,500
That's going to be a G, this G.

00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,500
Now let's repeat our experiment, I press this new one down silently,

00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,500
and then again strike this fundamental C.

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,500
What do we hear now? That G, right?

00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,500
A new tone, again clear as a bell. You want to hear it again?

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,300
Now we've just reached a very significant point.

00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,300
Have you noticed that the fundamental tone and its first overtone

00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,500
are really the same note C but an octive apart.

00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,500
But this new overtone G is a fifth away from C.

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:22,300
So we now have two different tones. And once they are established in our ears,

00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,500
we are in possession of the key to the whole tonal system,

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,200
a system based on the concept of tonic and dominant.

00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,000
Tonic and dominant.

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:41,500
This C represents the idea of tonic, which has the function of establishing the tonal center of any given key.

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,100
And the function of the dominant, is to aid and abet in the establishment of that tonality,

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,500
through a special relationship it enjoys with the tonic, owing to their proximity in the harmonic series.

00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
But more of that later.

00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,500
Right now onto the next overtone which is again a C,

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,500
a fourth higher than the G we've just heard.

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,500
Shall we repeat the experiment? I press it down silently, there it is, you hear it?

00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,500
Shall we do it again?

00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,500
Now the next one is again a new pitch.

00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,500
This time a third higher than its predecessor.

00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,500
Notice that the intervals are getting progessively smaller as we ascend the series,

00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,500
began with an octive and then a fifth and then a fourth and then, now, a third.

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,500
And the new overtone will be this note E. Listen.

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,500
It's a bit fainter, but it's there for all to hear. Shall I try it again?

00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:03,500
Hear it way back there? One last time. It's clear.

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,200
And there you have the first four overtones of the series:

00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:14,500
A fundamental plus one two three four, three of which are of different pitches,

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,500
those three. Now it must be obvious to you that these three notes rearranged in scale order,

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,500
constitute what is known as the major triad, which is the very nucleus,

00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,100
the cornerstone of most of the music we hear from day to day,

00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,500
whether it's a symphony or a hymn, or a blues.

00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,200
And this triad with its tonic-dominant relationship,

00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,500
plus the third sandwiched between,

00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:50,000
this triad is the fundation of Western tonal music as it developed

00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:55,200
of the last three centuries or so, along with the development of our western culture in general.

00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,200
Let's not make the mistake that so many people make

00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,200
of regarding this triad as the basic universal.

00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,200
That's a miscomprehension that's far too common,

00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:12,200
in that it fails to recognise that our accidental culture is only one of many world's cultures,

00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,200
in spite of its current prevalence and its worldwide influence;

00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:20,200
and in spite of the fact that it thinks it's the only important culture.

00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:26,200
A perfect example of this, a fact of this misconception

00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:29,200
arises with the very next overtone in the series,

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,200
which is a stranger to the western tonal culture.

00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,200
In fact this next overtone does not even appear on the piano,

00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,200
which means I cannot demonstrate it for you as I have for the preceding ones.

00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:45,200
More exactly stated, it is not to be found on the piano in its natural, pure form

00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:49,200
as it derives by physical law from that fundamental C string.

00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,200
Let me digress a moment to tell you why.

00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:58,000
You see this piano, like all keyboard instruments, is a tempered instrument

00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:02,100
which means its notes have been tempered or "tampered with"

00:39:02,211 --> 00:39:06,100
(I don't mean a joke by that, just mean to clarify the word).

00:39:06,211 --> 00:39:11,100
So that each one of them, each one of these notes can serve its function in all

00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,100
twelve keys at once.

00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:20,100
This readjustment in tuning became inevitable when music reached its tonal adulthood,

00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:24,000
around 1700; and found that it didn't have to remain in one key

00:39:24,005 --> 00:39:27,000
from the beginning to the end of a piece,

00:39:27,205 --> 00:39:30,200
but can modulate from one key to another in the course of it;

00:39:30,205 --> 00:39:34,400
but the notes deriving naturally from the harmonic series

00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:38,400
will work only in one key at a time. Do you follow that?

00:39:38,505 --> 00:39:43,400
One key at a time. That is what in tune in one key

00:39:43,605 --> 00:39:47,400
is likely to be out of tune in another.

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,400
Would you believe that if this piano were to encompass only natural untempered tones,

00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,400
this single octive space

00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:02,400
would have to contain 77 different keys?

00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,400
Well, you can understand that a compromise has to be made somewhere,

00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,400
and that "somewhere" was the moment in history

00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,400
when the rapid development of tonal harmony

00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:18,400
coinciding with the equally rapid development of the keyboard instruments with their fixed, unchangeable tones.

00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:22,400
And that is how the tempered clavier chord came to be,

00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,400
to say nothing of this Baldwin Grand.

00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:28,400
And that's why I can't play you this next overtone.

00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:32,400
But if we actually approach it pianistically

00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:39,400
in our ascent of the harmonic series, we find it somewhere around here,

00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,400
lying in the crack, between this B flat

00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,400
and this A; it's one of those blue notes.

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,400
And that blue note can be construed by the human ear as either the higher version of the note -- B flat;

00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,400
or the lower version A.

00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:08,400
In either case it requires a little push up or down to be accommodated on the piano.

00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,000
But whichever way we construe it, it becomes our newest overtone.

00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:16,000
So we are now equipped with four different overtones: the C

00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,000
plus the G plus the E

00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:22,000
plus that blue note, a dubious A.

00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,000
Or if we rearrange them in scale order,

00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:30,000
C-E-G and sort of A,

00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:36,000
and here we hear a real musical linguistic universal,

00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,000
because now we can understand and explain that famous worldwide teasing chat:

00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,000
Oly Oly Anfrey;

00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,000
because all it is is a constellation of those first four different overtones,

00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,000
with the tonic omitted, or rather implied.

00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,000
You see this tonic C,

00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,000
which is the same note as the fundamental C

00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,000
is heard in the mind's ear, and only the three new overtones are sound.

00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:14,300
And so these three universal notes are handed us by nature on a silver platter.

00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,300
But why are they in this different order?

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,300
Because that's the very order in which they appear in the harmonic series.

00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:30,800
G-E and sort of A and Q-E-D

00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,300
Now this is a substantive universal,

00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,300
the sort of thing linguists hunger for,

00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,300
but the likeness of which are simply unavailable to them.

00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,000
Indeed, as we ascend further in our harmonic series,

00:42:43,003 --> 00:42:48,000
more and more fascinating and incontrovertible universals keep appearing.

00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:54,300
For instance this next new overtone is this one, that is the new overtone,

00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,300
is this one D.

00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,300
So now we have five different tones to play with,

00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,300
which we again put into scale order.

00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:15,300
And presto a new universal is given us the 5 note or pentatonic scale.

00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,000
And because of that dubious last note, the scale can take either of two forms.

00:43:22,005 --> 00:43:27,500
One culminating in B flat, and the other culminating in A.

00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,200
Let's opt to the second of these, the lower one,

00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,200
which is by far the most common of the two.

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,200
This is humanity's favourite pentatonic scale, and by the way,

00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,200
this is the scale you can find so easily on your own piano by playing only the black notes.

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,200,
In fact, the universality of this scale is so well-known,

00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,200
that I'm sure you can give me examples of it from all corners of the earth:

00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:03,200
from Scotland -- pure pentatonic;

00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:20,200
or from China; or from Africa

00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:27,200
and from the American-Indian cultures, and from Eastern Indian cultures and from central and south Amerima,

00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,200
and Australia and Finland and

00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,200
Well, that's a true musical linguistic universal.

00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,200
But let's be careful about making linguistic analogies.

00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,200
We could conceivably equate a fundamental tone, such as this C,

00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,200
with the basic morpheme "ma", which we discovered before

00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,200
and then extend the parallel equating the overtones of that fundamental C

00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:57,200
with a set of words evolving from that "ma" syllable.

00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,200
Maybe! It's all still speculation.

00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,000
But what appears to be much more convincing

00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,200
is the analogy between Chomtsky's innate grammatical competence

00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:14,200
and the innate musical grammatical competence, which we may all possess universally;

00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:20,200
that is our in-built capacity to construe those naturally serialised overtones

00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:23,200
and to contrue them in different ways.

00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:30,200
Just as the various cultures of the world may have construed basic monogenetic materials

00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:35,200
and constructed out of them thousands of particular grammars or languages,

00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,200
all different from one another.

00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:45,200
Analagously, varied human cultures can construe this pentatonic scale in different ways,

00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:52,200
depending for example on which of the five notes is taken to be the tonal center.

00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,200
For example this one:

00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,200
that's one way.

00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,200
Or this one:

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,200
you see how it makes the whole different pentatonic but the same five notes.

00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,200
Or this one, same five notes again but a different scale.

00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,200
And there is always that blue notes to be considered.

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,200
If the ear construes it as the upper B flat instead of the lower A,

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,200
it will give us a whole other pentatonic scale,

00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,200
which produces some beautiful African music.

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,000
And there are even much more complix processes which we won't go into,

00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:44,200
but which account for the existence of the highly differentiated Japanese pentatonic scale.

00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,200
Does that sound familiar?

00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,200
Or the unique pentatonic of the Balinese music.

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,200
But enough of pentatonics. I think we have seen enough of the way the harmonic series uprates,

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,200
to recognise the fact that as we ascend the series,

00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,200
always finding new tones to be added (Oops..).

00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,200
There we are, to be added to our collection,

00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:28,200
we can eventually account for six and seven notes scales including Greek modes and church modes,

00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:34,200
and the diatonic scales both major and minor, and eventually all twelve tones

00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:38,200
of our so-called chromatic scale;

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,200
which is of course due to the merit of tempering,

00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,200
we get those twelve equidistant tones.

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:55,200
And you may well ask why just twelve tones. Patience, you'll find out in a minute.

00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,200
But even these twelve tones don't exauhst the potential of the harmonic series;

00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,200
the upper reaches of the seires contintue

00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:09,200
to furnish us with intervals even smaller than the half tones that make up our chromatic scale.

00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:17,200
Intervals such as quarter tones, or even thirds and fifths of tones,

00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:21,200
all of which are still inhabit the areas of experimentation,

00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,200
like electronic research;

00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:29,200
to say nothing of microtones, which are such an essential part of so much oriental music.

00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,200
But the overwriting fact that emerges from all this

00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:38,200
is that all music, whether pop, folk, symphonic

00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:45,200
modal, tonal, atonal, poly-tonal, micro-tonal, well-tempered or ill-tempered,

00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:50,200
music from the distant past or the imminent future, all of it

00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:56,200
has a common origin in the universal phenomenon of the harmonic serials.

00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,200
And that is our case for musical monogenesis.

00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:04,200
But is it necessarily a case for music universality? Think!

00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:10,200
What about those Hindu Ragas so many people find difficult to comprehend.

00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,200
Well I suggest a simple answer.

00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:20,200
In the light of our linguistic analogies, just as the grammars of human languages,

00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:23,200
even mutually unintelligible ones,

00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,200
may have sprung from the same monogenetic sources,

00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:33,200
so in the same way, highly varied musical tongues,

00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:39,200
which are also strangers to one another, can be said to have developed out of their common origins.

00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,200
In purely phonological terms,

00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:46,200
these tongues are tonal languages that have developed out of a universal,

00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:50,200
naturally ordered, tonal structure.

00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,200
Now I trust you realise that all of this has been enormously compressed

00:49:55,205 --> 00:50:00,200
and undocumented by historical musical examples, because that will take all night;

00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:06,200
but this is not a linguistics course; nor is it a history of music course.

00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:10,200
What we are trying for is a very high overview

00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:16,200
of musical development in terms of a vocabulary constantly being enriched,

00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,200
by more and more remote and chromatic overtones.

00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:28,200
It's as if we can see the whole of music developing from prehistory to the present in two minutes.

00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:36,200
Let's again pretend we're homonids, and that the smash hit moment is, let's say Fair Harvard.

00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,200
Here we are, in our homonid hut crooning,

00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:52,200
and now maybe our wives and maybe our pre-pubescence sons join in,

00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,200
and automatically, we are singing not in unison, but in octives,

00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:00,200
since men's and women's voices are naturally an octive apart.

00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:11,200
Now that octive interval, I wish I could sing an octive so I can really show you what I mean.

00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:16,200
But that octive interval happens to be the first interval of the harmonic series as you remember, right?

00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:24,200
OK. Now centuries passed and the next interval of the harmonic series is assimilated by humanity,

00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:29,200
namely the fifth. And now we can be singing this.

00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:40,200
Now of course this little change brings us forward a mere ten million years,

00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:46,200
into the tenth century AD, and into a fairly sophisticated musical culture.

00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,200
But now we admit the next interval of the series, the fourth;

00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:57,200
and now we can mix intervals of the octive and the fifth and the fourth.

00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,200
Now that's beginning to sound like polyphony.

00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:14,200
And again comes a great leap, as music absorbs the next overtone, the third.

00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,200
And just listen to the difference.

00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:27,200
It's a whole new music, richer, mellower, with a new colouristic warmth.

00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,200
And as we know, this new interval of the third,

00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,200
bacause I like the older sound better, anyway, ah...

00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:39,200
As we know this new interval of the third introduces into music

00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,200
the phenomenon of the triad,

00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:47,200
so that now Fair Harvard can begin to sound more like its Victorian self.

00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:56,200
And so there was born, what we now call, tonal music;

00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:03,200
a stable tonal language, firmly rooted in the basic notes of the harmonic series:

00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:07,200
The fundamental and its first different overtone, the fifth;

00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:13,200
now and for evermore to be known as the tonic and the dominant.

00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,200
And that fifth interval really does dominate,

00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,200
because once this tonic-dominant relationship is established,

00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,200
it's a field day for composers.

00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,200
There can be now a fifth of fifth of fifth of fifth;

00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:33,200
each one of them, a new tonic producing a new dominant, a whole circle of fifths;

00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:38,200
twelve of them in fact; always winding up with the starting tone;

00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,200
whether proceeding upwards, let's say from the low C,

00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:48,200
G, D, A, E, B, F#, C#, G#, Eb, Bb, F, C.

00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,200
That's again C,  believe it or not that?

00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,200
Or proceeding downwards, starting from that

00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:03,200
C, F, Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, B, E, A, D, G, C

00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:09,200
back to C, that's the circle of twelve fifths, and that's the answer I promised you;

00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,200
that's how we got our twelve different tones of our chromatic scale.

00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,200
Because if you take all those twelve of the circle of fifths,

00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:21,200
and put them together in scale order, you'll get this.

00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:28,200
And what's more those twelve notes generate a circle of twelve different keys,

00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,200
through which, thanks to the perfecting of the tempered system,

00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:39,200
composers can now go free willing at their own chromatic pleasure.

00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:48,200
And this means ultimately Fear Harvard can sound like this.

00:54:55,300 --> 00:55:03,200
That's chromatic porrige; and in our own century it's going to become goulash.

00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:09,200
How does music contain this loose runny chromaticism?

00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,200
By the basic principle of diatonicism;

00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:18,200
that stable relationship of tonics, and dominants,

00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:26,200
sub-dominants, and super-tonics and new dominants and new tonics,

00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:31,200
and we can now modulate as freely as we want, as chromatically as we want,

00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,200
and still have complete tonal control.

00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:46,200
This great system of tonal controls was perfected and codified by Bach, J.S.Bach,

00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:52,200
whose genius was to balance so delicately and so justly

00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,200
these two forces of chromaticism and diatonicism,

00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,200
forces that were equally powerful and presumably contradictory in nature.

00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,200
And this point of delicate balance

00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:09,200
is like the still center in the stormy flux of musical history.

00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,200
A condition of such stability

00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,200
that was able to continue without remarkable changes for almost a century;

00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:22,200
and this roughly a hundred years became a golden age.

00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:28,200
This is not to say that there weren't drastic changes in style and form during those hundrend years.

00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:33,200
It's after all this golden age saw emergence of a whole new Rococo style;

00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,200
to say nothing of the phenomenal rise of sonata form

00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:45,200
and the hands of such giants as C.P.E.Bach and Haydn and Mozart and Beethoven himself.

00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,200
But these changes are syntactic and semantic changes,

00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:53,200
which will be examining and enjoying in future lectures.

00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,200
Right now, we are limiting our investigation to phonology;

00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,200
and in these terms, we can see the peak attained by Bach,

00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:08,200
continuing as a kind of a plateau, level and lofty right into the music of Beethoven.

00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:15,200
Now at this point, I'd like to invite you to listen with me to one of the supreme examples of this golden age:

00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:22,200
Mozart's G minor symphony, a work of utmost passion utterly controlled

00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:26,200
and of free chromaticism elegantly contained.

00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:33,200
I'll try to prepare you a bit somewhat with a few illustrations of this control and containment,

00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:39,200
so that you can hear the symphony, hopefully with fresh phonological ears.

00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:46,200
And remember what we are looking for is the wonderfully creative way in which chromatic flexibility

00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:52,200
can be systematically contained within the framework of tonic-dominant relationships.

00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:56,200
It's a curious thing and a crucial one,

00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:00,200
that through this perfect combination of opposites,

00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:08,200
chromaticism and diatonicism, there is distiled the essence of ambiguity of all things.

00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,200
This word "ambiguity" may seem to be the most unlikely word

00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:15,200
to use in speaking of a golden age composer like Mozart,

00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,200
a master of clarity and precision.

00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:24,200
But ambiguity has always inhabited musical art, indeed all the arts;

00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,200
because it is one of art's most potent aesthetic functions.

00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:34,200
The more ambiguous, the more expressive, up to a certain point, of course there is a limit,

00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,200
which we are going to run into in the course of these lectures.

00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:42,200
We are going to run into a state of such increased ambiguity

00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,200
that problems of musical clarity are bound to arise;

00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:52,200
and that's where we'll be confronted head on by Ive's unanswered question: whither.

00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,800
Meanwhile, we are still in the golden age

00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,200
with ambiguity classically contained in the Augusten balances and proportions

00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,200
in here into this Mozart's symphony.

00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,200
Let's look at it very briefly.

00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:11,200
You all remember the opening in first movement.

00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:25,200
This whole section moves quite easily and diatonically from its G minor

00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:31,200
tonic, to its first kins, which is naturally enough on the dominant.

00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:38,200
And just as easily slipping back into the tonic.

00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,200
Back we are.

00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,200
Now, of course you remember that this tonic-dominant relationship

00:59:48,205 --> 00:59:51,200
arises from the adjacency of the fundamental tone,

00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:55,200
in this case this G, with its first overtone that basic interval of the fifth.

00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:00,200
And from there the music proceeds by a circle of fifths,

01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,200
downward circle of fifths;

01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:10,200
to it's relative major Bb, which is exactly where it's supposed to be

01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,200
for the appearence of the second thematic section.

01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:22,200
But notice that Mozart's theme has already chromatically formed;

01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,200
and it gets more so as it goes on;

01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:31,200
and even more so as it repeats.

01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:39,200
What's this? A whole new key, Ab major;

01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:43,200
a sudden new key, unrelated to either Bb or G minor.

01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:48,200
How did we get here? By the well-known circle of fifths.

01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:58,200
Did you hear those stable consecutive fifths striding inexorably from domanmints to tonic in the base.

01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:06,200
Dominant-tonic, Dominant-tonic, Dominant-tonic.

01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:14,200
While above the melodical line descends by chromatic half steps into the nether regions of Ab major.

01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:19,200
There's that the classical balance we are talking about: chromatic wandering on the top,

01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,200
but firmly supported by the tonic-dominant structure underneath.

01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:33,200
And you see now what I meant by the beauty of ambiguity,

01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:40,200
it is combination of those two contradictory forces: chromaticism and diatonicism,

01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:44,200
uprating at the same time, that makes this passage so expressive.

01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,200
So we are in the midst of chromatic adventure, right?

01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:55,200
How do we get out of this strange Ab territory.

01:01:55,300 --> 01:02:00,200
By a simple chromatic shift like side-slipping on skis.

01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:08,200
And there we are back safely in Bb major where we belong.

01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:14,000
Now, if you could follow that, you could follow any number of similar adventures.

01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:17,200
For instance, the way Mozart starts his development section.

01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,200
It's established as firmly in Bb major.

01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:23,200
But no!

01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,200
Off he goes on another chromatic adventure,

01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:36,200
which lands us in the impossible key of F# minor.

01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:40,200
Now this was done by absolute whim arbitrarily;

01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,200
it's a bit of chromatic acrobatics if you will,

01:02:43,203 --> 01:02:46,200
startling passage with development section,

01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:51,200
which is what the development section should be, a startling new looks at old material.

01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:56,200
But eventually he must get us back to a recapitulation in G minor,

01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,200
the original home soil.

01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:02,200
And he is completely free to make this journey as chromatically as he wishes,

01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:06,200
his fantacy is totally released; it's a development section.

01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,200
Freewheeling to act!

01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:15,200
But even here, the basic diatonic laws contain and control that freewheeling,

01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,200
passion and fantacy.

01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:22,200
And all by those progressions of fifths, the dominant seeking it's tonic,

01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,200
and each tonic turning into a dominant seeking its tonic,

01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,200
and that tonic tuning into seeking its own tonic and over and over again.

01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:33,200
We are in F# minor right?

01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,200
Now through a sequence of such progressons,

01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:44,200
it changes that F# minor tonality from tonic function to a dominant function,

01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:47,200
which is seeking its tonic B natural,

01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:52,200
and here we are, here is that B natural.

01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:58,200
And B natural as a dominant seeking its tonic E. And so into E we go;

01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:04,200
and by the same chain of fifths, E seeks A.

01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,200
That's A, then A seeks D.

01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:17,200
D -- and so on through the circle until we finally lead back home to G minor.

01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:23,200
But even this leaning to the home key is chromatically written,

01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,200
firmly held in place of course, by the dominant pedal.

01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,200
Listen to this creepy crawly chromaticism.

01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:52,200
We are back to our old so gratifying and welcome recapitulation in G minor.

01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:59,200
Now I must point out that these adventures are much more complex and subtle than I made them sound;

01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,200
the procedure is not always exactly by fifths;

01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,200
there are twists and turns which will take

01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:09,200
hours to describe acurately even to a classroom of Harvard music students.

01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:16,200
The best I can do is to give you some insight into this marvel of ambiguity.

01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:20,100
The diatonic containment of chromaticism,

01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,200
so that when you hear, for instance, this second movement,

01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:27,200
this extraordinary chromatic passage,

01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:36,200
you can also be aware of the strong diatonic underpinnings:

01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:41,200
those fifths again striding inexorably from tonic to dominant.

01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,200
See if you can hear them.

01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:59,200
Even in the third movement, the minuet, which is extremely diatonic; it's hardly chromatic at all,

01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:09,200
Mozart can't resist just before the end one of his charming chromatic excursions.

01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:17,200
But instantly it all writes itself in the classical tonic-dominant cadence.

01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,200
But the most breath-taking chromatic trip of all occurs in the final movement,

01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,200
which begins as you remember

01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:36,200
Innocent enough and tonally not too eventful throughout the whole exposition.

01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:42,200
But then again comes the development section, and all hell breaks loose.

01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:53,200
Do you realise that wild and tonal sonic passage

01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:59,200
contains every one of the twelve chromatic tones except the tonic G.

01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:05,200
What an inspired idea! All the notes except the tonic.

01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:15,200
It could easily pass for 20th century's music if we didn't already know that it was Mozart.

01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:21,200
But event that explosion of chromaticism is explainable in terms of the circle of fifths.

01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,200
Not that I dream of burdening you with it.

01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:28,200
But take my words for it that outburst of chromatic rage

01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:33,200
is classically contained and so is the climax of this development section,

01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:40,200
which finds itself suddenly in the key of, it's not so sudden, in the key of C# minor.

01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:48,200
C# minor which is as far away as you can get from the home key of G minor,

01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,200
sounds pretty remote, doesn't it?

01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:58,200
And again believe me all these phonological arrivals and departures,

01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,200
to and from the most distantly remote areas,

01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:08,200
operating in the smoothest, most Mozartian way under perfect diatonic control.

01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:11,200
Well, what is all this add up to?

01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:15,200
Let's find out by hearing the whole work,

01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:20,200
as performed on film by the Boston symphony orchestra.

01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:27,200
And I hope we will be listening to it with fresh phonological ears.

01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,200
What a piece!

01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:07,200
Now last night, at the first presentation of this lecture, the Harvard's Great theatre,

01:40:08,300 --> 01:40:15,200
this performance of Mozart's symphony was interrupted in the middle of first movement by a bomb scare.

01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:20,200
And we all had to go out into the street;

01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:24,200
nobody knowing whether we were going to come back and resume or not;

01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:28,200
and wait for almost an hour,

01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:34,200
until we had word that the police cleared the whole theatre.

01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:39,200
And during that wait,

01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:43,200
I must say that I was sick at heart and

01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:49,200
overcome by despair because why had I been

01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:58,200
talking my guts out for an hour and a half on human brotherhood and universality

01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:09,200
only to have this kind of despicable disproof of human brotherhood thrown in our faces.

01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:16,200
And when I came back, and we all came back, and so many of the audiences did come back.

01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:18,200
My amazement.

01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,200
And listen from the beginning again, through to the end of this symphony.

01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:30,200
I must say that my faith was restored, and doubled;

01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:35,200
not only by this incredible piece of music,

01:41:35,300 --> 01:41:42,200
which I guess if one have to point to a work that symbolised in itself the

01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:49,200
essence of the whole fustian experience of man,

01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:53,200
since the Renaissance; this will be it.

01:41:55,300 --> 01:42:01,200
But also because of the number of the audience that waited it out,

01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:06,200
and came back, and listened to it. Terribly moved.

01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:13,200
Of course, I wouldn't have been so upset if the interruption had come during my talk,

01:42:13,205 --> 01:42:19,200
but interrupt Mozart, which were that extraordinary

01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:25,200
wholeness and continuity, that entity which is this work,

01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:29,200
was the greatest insult of all.

01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:36,200
But as I say my faith was restored, just to hear it;

01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:42,200
and just to hear it with those people, and through them.

01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:50,200
So I feel even more confident over what I was trying to say in the beginning

01:42:50,300 --> 01:42:52,200
than I had when wrote it.

01:42:54,300 --> 01:43:01,200
Just a short word now about our subject next time, which will be syntax.

01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:06,200
If you remember the second of the three linguistic departments.

01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:10,200
Musical and linguistic syntax,

01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:15,200
in which we will be examining the actual formations

01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:19,200
of these phonological elements we've been discussing this time.

01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:23,200
And then we'll be ready to understand the semantic problems

01:43:23,300 --> 01:43:26,200
of music from Mozart to the present.

01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:35,200
And hopefully come closer and closer to understanding, and maybe even answering Ive's unanswered question.

01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:37,200
Thank you.
